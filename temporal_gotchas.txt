when syncing over a network:
- input-generating waves should be at the same time or with a delta > latency
- input-generating waves should have the same speed
- it is assumed that all events that affect the state at the other side of a jump are
	caused by the wave that does the jump (requires present-time invulnerability of at least latency time)

- if a timewave has passed the point of an event that is to be inserted from the network the local
	representation of the input-generating timewave (and possibly some additional ones) will have
	more information than they should have
